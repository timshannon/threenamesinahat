                <ol>
                    <li>Players are split between two teams</li>
                    <li>Players take turns trying to get their team to guess the name they are given.</li>
                    <li>Each round continues until there are no more names left.</li>
                    <li>After 3 rounds the team with the most guessed names wins.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Rounds</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Give clues as long as it's not part of the person's name or a direct reference to their name.
                        For example they can't do things like "rhymes with" or "starts with X" or "ends with X".</li>
                    <li>Same as previous rounds, except <strong>no words</strong>, only acting out silent clues.</li>
                    <li>Same as round one except this time you only get <strong>one word</strong>.</li>
                </ol>
