                    This simple party game is one my friends and family always enjoy playing. However the recent
                    Covid-19 world-wide pandemic has made playing party games a little difficult. I felt it was the
                    perfect quarantine project to turn this simple party game into one that could be played remotely
                    while we all are social distancing.
